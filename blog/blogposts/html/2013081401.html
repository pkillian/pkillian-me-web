<p>It's no secret that the tech industry is bursting at the seams with jobs. From San Francisco, to Seattle, all the way to the Silicon Valley of the East, Washington, D.C.; tech jobs are everywhere. This fact is so apparent that students are starting to change majors simply because of their desires to have a job upon graduation <i>(how dare they, right?)</i>. Unfortunately, an increasing number of these students will do whatever it takes to get their degree.</p>

<p><span class="citation" id="_1">Microsoft's report on talent in the tech industry<sup>[1]</sup></span> provides raw data to what many managers have known for some time: there just aren't enough degrees to meet the demand. Even so, an increasing number of <span class="citation" id="_2">illegally unpaid<sup >[2]</sup></span> internships has become prevalent on college campuses. Startups in particular will offer a prospective intern the 'opportunity' to be apart of their groundbreaking team. These companies have all the ammenities, the capital and the business logic; they simply don't practice ethical hiring on the internship level. It's rather upsetting that a small minority of businesses can ruin the opinions of similar places for practices such as this.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum all-together exist the massive recruit-heavy companies such as Facebook and Google. These havens of technical prowess reward their interns and new hires lavishly. Hourly wages that break the national median salary; signing bonuses that offer a massive head-start for a recent college graduate; perks and benefits that used to accompany the position of a seasoned veteran in the industry.</p>
