<p>I'll preface by saying my academic experiences may vary greatly from your own. My alma mater is anything but ordinary; the typical day on campus is a day as unique as the last one. From streakers, to protestors, to police wearing riot gear; anything can be expected on campus. We never really experience the same things two days in a row, and that fact has turned out to be a great learning opportunity for me. But amidst even one of the most prestigious learning environments exists and overall tension in certain circles.</p>
