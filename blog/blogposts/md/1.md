Recently, I've been looking into contributing more and more code to open source projects on [Github](http://github.com/pkillian) as a way of learning more, giving back to the community, and creating a name for myself. In this pursuit, I stumbled across a few amazing projects to which I'll hopefully contribute a hefty amount of work. All that aside, stumbling across [AngularJS's Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format) may be the most game changing thing I've seen in my open-source pursuit.

Now, before you scoff at the "groundbreaking" mention of a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, hear me out. The companies I've been fortunate enough to work for have all had the greatest of intentions. At the start of a project, cleanliness has always been a point of emphasis. Usually, however, that cleanliness doesn't persist forever. A few weeks/months/years into a project, the code friendliness decays past a point of maintenance and becomes a burden on the developers. If you've been unfortunate enough to encounter this decay and need an alternative to keep you sane, AngularJS's guidelines for commits may be just what you're looking for.<end/>

By maintaining a strict set of rules that govern your team's version control strategoes, productivity will no longer be wasted on finding sane versions to roll back to. Those wasted hours staring at one line commit logs like:
```
Author: Patrick Killian <pkillian@berkeley.edu>
Date:   Fri Jan 09 10:15:10 2014 -0500
    fixing bug in Controllers.js
```
can be better spent authoring new commits that speak for themselves entirely.
