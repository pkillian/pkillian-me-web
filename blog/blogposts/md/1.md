# How to build

The basic outline is this: there are 6 jars in the libs folder that the project depends on. Additionally you need one of my library projects, HoloTheme. It's basically a collection of utility classes & method's I've built up over time. HoloTheme also has a dependency on android-support-v4.jar (as does HackerNews).

To get what you need, run these commands from a shell:
```
git clone https://github.com/bishopmatthew/HackerNews.git
cd HackerNews/libs
git clone https://github.com/bishopmatthew/HoloTheme.git
```<end/>

##### IntelliJ
In IntelliJ, add HoloTheme as a module and create a module dependency from HackerNews on HoloTheme. Then create a library out of the 6 jars, and add it as a compile dependency to HackerNews and a provided dependency to HoloTheme.

##### Eclipse
I haven't used Eclipse in a while, but you should be able to add HoloTheme as a library project. Then add the 6 jars to the build path of HackerNews if it doesn't happen automatically. You may also have to copy android-support-v4 from HackerNews/libs into HackerNews/libs/HoloTheme/libs.

##### Android Studio
If you're using Android Studio:
- Go into `File > Project Structure...` and add the HoloTheme repository you cloned earlier as Android Library modules (`Modules > New Module > Library Module` under the Android section in the `New Module` dialog).
- Under the `HoloTheme` module, add all the jars in the `./libs/` folder as "provided" dependencies.
- Under the `HackerNews` module, add all of the jars in the `./libs/` folder as "compile" dependencies.
- Under the `HackerNews` module, add the `HoloTheme`module as dependencies (Using the `Module Dependency` option when adding them).

# Design Overview

I've outlined the design in in [this wiki article](https://github.com/bishopmatthew/HackerNews/wiki/Design-Overview). This might also be helpful if you're interested in writing Android apps.

# How to help

If you tackle any of the issues on the tracker, that would be great! I've added a few enhancements there with a pretty detailed description of what needs to be done.
