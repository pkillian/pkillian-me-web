Recently, I've been looking into contributing more and more code to open source projects on [Github](http://github.com) as a way of learning more, giving back to the community, and creating a name for myself. In this pursuit, I stumbled across a few amazing projects to which I'll hopefully contribute a hefty amount of work. All that aside, stumbling across [AngularJS's Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format) may be the most game changing thing I've seen in my open-source pursuit.

Now, before you scoff at the mention of a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, hear me out. The companies I've been fortunate enough to work for have all had the greatest of intentions. At the start of a project, cleanliness has always been a point of emphasis.
